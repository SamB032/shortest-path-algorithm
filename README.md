First program provides a GUI interface that will for any given node, find the shortest path between those 2 points. You are able to draw barrier in between that the path finding cannot get past. The first click of the left mouse will be the start point, second click will be the end point, after this it will produce barriers. Right click any node on the interface to remove a point. After your happy with your drawing. You can click the ```SPACEBAR``` to run the algorithm and find the shortest path. If at any point you want to reset the grid, press ```c``` and it should clear the grid
